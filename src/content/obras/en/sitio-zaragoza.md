Military fantasy commemorating the city's heroic resistance during the Peninsular War. It is perhaps Oudrid's most popular work, frequently performed by bands and orchestras.

The piece is a brilliant *pasticcio* that integrates popular themes such as the Aragonese Jota and military marches, building a sonic fresco of great emotional impact. The Association is working on a new edition based on the autograph manuscript.
